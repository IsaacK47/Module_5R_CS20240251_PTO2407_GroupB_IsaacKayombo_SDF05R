This is my German inspired button design styles where my color scheme follows the national colors of Germany.

  I am really proud of the animations I was able to create using CSS. I have always wondered how facncy animations are created on web pages, so being able to learn to basics of CSS animations has been very interesting but very confusing on certain parts.
One of things I struggled with was working with more than one keyframe property on one specific Class/Element.
I wasn't really sure of what the problem was and how to solve it. Could it have been a specificity problem or something else, I am not 100% sure.

Overall I am glad I managed to complete the task as best as I could with my own understanding. CSS seems like it can be a very overwhelming, but I won't give up.
